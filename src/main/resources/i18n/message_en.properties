Is your course essential to their career,<br>relationships, and lifestyles?  How?<br>. Look at message boards, forums, reviews of<br>other similar books or products to learn what<br>students ask for in other places?  How will your course meet those needs?<br> <br>Then write your course objectives with the<br>beginning \u201DAt the end of the course, students will be able to... (Start with a verb. and include details on specific skills students will learn or<br>where students can apply them.)\u201C

firststep_credits_tip=As a credit course, students can gain a credit<br>(basically equal to 2.5 ETCS), after participate<br>14~16 class hours. Generally, each class hour is<br>between 45 to 50 minutes. Because you don\u2019t<br>need to review the last one at the beginning of the<br>lecture and also no need to conclude the content<br>of this lecture in video lectures, usually 20 to 25<br>minutes  video lectures can be counted as a class<br>hour.

firststep_keshushi_tip=In order to ensure personalized learning and<br>independent learning, as well as help students<br>carry out discussion and collaborative interactive<br>learning, we suggest that the portion of video<br>lectures class hour and face to face lectures class<br>hour should between 2\:1 and 3\:1. \uFF08e.g.  A  two-credit course requires 32 class hours. Usually it has 600<br> minutes video lectures account for 24 class hours,<br>and 4 times face to face lectures account for 8<br>class hours.
firststep_pianhua_tip=Promo video is a short video with 2~3 minutes<br>length designed for helping students to learn the<br>basic information, teaching objectives, teaching<br>approach and lecturers of the course, etc.
